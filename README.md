## 🚀 About Me

I’m an engineer transitioning into data — bringing real-world systems experience into analytics and data engineering.

My background is in **electrical construction and field engineering**, where I worked on large-scale projects, coordinated operations in fast-paced environments, and solved practical on-site problems. That experience shaped how I approach data today: structured thinking, reliability, and solutions that work in the real world.

Now I’m focused on building strong skills in:

- 🐍 Python for data analysis and engineering  
- 🗄 SQL and database querying  
- 📊 Data analysis & visualization  
- 🤖 Machine learning fundamentals  
- ⚙️ Data pipelines and ETL concepts  

I enjoy turning messy, real-world data into clear insights and usable systems.

## 🧩 Engineering Background

Before transitioning into tech, I worked as a **Field Engineer on electrical construction projects**, where I:

- Coordinated field operations and logistics  
- Interpreted technical plans and specifications  
- Solved real-time problems under tight constraints  
- Focused on efficiency, execution, and system reliability  

That experience gives me a practical mindset when working with data systems — I think in terms of **performance, structure, and real-world impact**, not just theory.
